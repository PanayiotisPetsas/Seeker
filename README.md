# Seeker
A videogame/project that I have been working on as a way to learn more about programming and enchance my skills in a more fun and interesting way.  

Title of the game: Seeker (Title might change)

Genre: 2D top-down veiw adventure game

Current version: 0.7

Current number of scenes: 3 - IntroductionScene, ButterflyBossArea, GameOverScene

Currently known bugs:
---------------------
⇢ Top-left movement is not working.

⇢ Beam can get out of the map. [FIXED]

⇢ Player can get pushed out the map. [FIXED] 

⇢ Beam effects do not destroy themselves after the effect is finished. [They stay invisible in the object hierarchy]

⇢ Game sometimes wont pause with 'Z'. [Occurs once the player has left the first scene]

⇢ (optional, depends on time left) Make inventory

⇢ (optional, depends on time left) Make a better GUI.


Keep in mind that by prior to me starting this project, I barely had any coding experience. This means that some of the first scripts that I wrote could have some errors. You can notice the difference between the first scripts to the latest to look at my improvement.
