# Seeker
A videogame/project that I have been working on as a way to learn more about programming and enchance my skills in a more fun and interesting way.

To do list to finish the game:
------------------------------
⇢ Finish GUI after boss dies. (code and design)   [DONE]
⇢ Make treasure appear through hidden path.   [DONE]
⇢ Make one more level with smaller enemies and a bigger map. [CURRENTLY WORKING ON]
⇢ Finish the GameOver scene.
⇢ (optional, depends on time left) Make inventory
⇢ (optional, depends on time left) Make a better GUI.

Keep in mind that by prior to me starting this project, I barely had any coding experience. This means that some of the first scripts that I wrote could have some errors. You can notice the difference between the first scripts to the latest to look at my improvement.
